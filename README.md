# Hypothesis Testing Tutorial ðŸ“Š

Welcome to the Hypothesis Testing Tutorial repository! This tutorial covers a wide range of parametric and non-parametric hypothesis tests commonly used in data science, presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

## Introduction
Hypothesis testing is a fundamental concept in statistics used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. It involves formulating a hypothesis about the population parameter and using statistical methods to determine whether the sample data provide enough evidence to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

## Types of Tests Covered
This tutorial covers both parametric and non-parametric hypothesis tests:

### Parametric Tests
- **Paired t-test:** Used to compare the means of two related samples.
- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** Used to compare the means of three or more independent groups.
- **Independent t-test:** Used to compare the means of two independent samples.

### Non-Parametric Tests
- **Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test:** Non-parametric alternative to the paired t-test for comparing two related samples.
- **Friedman Test:** Non-parametric alternative to repeated measures ANOVA for comparing three or more related samples.
- **Mann-Whitney U Test:** Non-parametric alternative to the independent t-test for comparing two independent samples.
- **Kruskal-Wallis Test:** Non-parametric alternative to ANOVA for comparing three or more independent groups.

## Examples
Each hypothesis test is accompanied by examples to illustrate its application in real-world scenarios. The examples are presented in Jupyter Notebooks, including datasets and step-by-step explanations of the hypothesis testing process.

## How to Use
To get started with the tutorial, simply navigate to the directory corresponding to the hypothesis test you're interested in. Each directory contains a Jupyter Notebook with the tutorial content and example code.
